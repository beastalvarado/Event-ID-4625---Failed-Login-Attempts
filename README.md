# Event-ID-4625-Failed-Login-Attempts
---
## Objective
This project demonstrates how to detect Windows Failed Login Attempts (Event ID 4625) using Splunk. It covers simulating failed logins, collecting logs, and writing SPL queries to identify suspicious activity such as unauthorized access attempts or brute-force attacks. This serves as a practical example of security monitoring in a SIEM environment.
---
### Tools Used
-Windows Server / Windows Workstation
Log source for simulating failed login attempts (Event ID 4625).

-Splunk Enterprise / Splunk Free
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform for log analysis and detection.

-NxLog
Log forwarding agent to send Windows Event Logs to Splunk.

-VirtualBox / VMware Workstation
Virtualization platform to run lab environments.

### ðŸ§ª Project Walkthrough
1. Simulating the Activity
To generate real log data, I simulated multiple failed login attempts by using Kali Linux to remotely attempt logins to my Windows Server using incorrect credentials. This activity generates Event ID 4625 in the Windows Security Logs.
2.Collecting and Analyzing the Logs
After simulating the activity, I switched to my Ubuntu Server where I have Splunk running to collect and analyze the Windows Event Logs. Using Splunk, I began reviewing the data to answer key security investigation questions.

ðŸ§  What Happened?
I used the stats count command to quickly check how many failed login attempts were captured.
  
ðŸš¨This confirmed that 10 failed login events (Event ID 4625) were generated.

ðŸ§  Who Did It and When Did It Happen?
I created a table to display the timestamp, source IP address, and source port for each failed login event.
All attempts originated from the source IP 192.168.1.13, which belongs to my Kali Linux machine. 

ðŸš¨The attempts occurred within seconds of each other, indicating a potential brute-force attempt simulation.

ðŸ§  Who Was Targeted?
I expanded the table to include the Account Domain and Account Name fields. This helped me confirm that the targeted account was "Administrator" on the "WINDOWS-DC0" domain.

ðŸš¨This is concerning because the Administrator account is a high-privilege target that attackers often go after to gain full control of a system.

ðŸ§  How Many Times Did It Happen?
After identifying the source IP, domain, and targeted account, I refined my SPL to focus specifically on those details and then counted the number of matching events to confirm the activity. The query confirmed that there were 10 failed login attempts targeting the Administrator account from the Kali Linux machine.

ðŸš¨Since these attempts happened in rapid succession, this could indicate brute-force behavior rather than a one-time user error.

ðŸ§© Additional Findings 

Logon Type: I noticed that the failed logins were using Logon Type 3 (Network Logon), which indicates attempts to log in over the network rather than locally. This aligns with the fact that the attempts came from another machine (Kali Linux).

Failure Reason: The logs provided a failure reason code, indicating that the logins failed due to unknown username or bad password. This further confirms that the attempts were unauthorized.

ðŸ§  Is This Normal or Suspicious?
Based on the evidence, this activity is suspicious and likely malicious.

The high number of failed attempts in a very short timeframe,

The targeting of the high-privilege "Administrator" account, and he attempts coming from a single external IP address.

ðŸš¨ Alert Creation 
The alert looks for 5 or more failed login attempts (Event ID 4625) from the same source IP and same account within a defined time range.

These patterns are consistent with brute-force attack behavior and would warrant further investigation or immediate response in a real-world security operations center (SOC).
