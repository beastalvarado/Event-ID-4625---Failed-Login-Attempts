# Event-ID-4625---Failed-Login-Attempts
This project demonstrates how to detect Windows Failed Login Attempts (Event ID 4625) using Splunk. It covers simulating failed logins, collecting logs, and writing SPL queries to identify suspicious activity such as unauthorized access attempts or brute-force attacks. This serves as a practical example of security monitoring in a SIEM environment.
